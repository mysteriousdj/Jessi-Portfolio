BootCamp Challenge - 02 Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

## Description

To create a professional portfolio. The will create an html describing the works that I have done or will do. It, also, contains a contact me block detailing my contact info. 

The style.css contains elements to create a better look on my html site.


## Process

To understand the objective of the challenge, I first read through the index.html, style.css and the README.md. I researched other portfolios to grasp an understanding on what companies want when looking at a porfolio. 

Throughout the index.html and style.css, I included comments to each section for easier configeration in the future.
